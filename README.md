# LinkedIn-Bot
Automated LinkedBot for sending connection requests with personalized messages.


## What is LinkedIn?
LinkedIn is the world's largest professional network on the internet. One can use LinkedIn to find the right job or internship, connect and strengthen professional relationships, and learn the skills they need to succeed.

#### So I have created LinkedIn Bot using selenium and BeautifulSoup python library, which can be used for automatically sending connection requests with personalized notes for a given search results.

There is a demo of the Bot with using "Google" in the search box.


### File Details:

1) Download the latest chrome driver suitable to your chrome version from: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
2) Add a config.txt file with your linkedin username/email-id and password
3) Bot.py is the file containing the code for automation
